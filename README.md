Sifting through Yahoo Lab's Data in python

The sample data is from Yahoo's messager, and shows info on time, date, zip code, and friend status.

Once I am able to read in all the data from all files, I will begin to analyze the data. Maybe I'll look into messages from strangers, if the strangers are in a similar zip code. Or the most popular time to message your friends during the week. I could see when it would be optimal to message your frined based off of average response time relative to time of day.
